# Gfgg_OS-Wii

Do you just wish that you could use the Wii Internet Channel once again, with crappy HTML, little to no CSS, and Javascript right from ChatGPT?

Well, now you can!

Gfgg OS, Wii Internet Browser Edition

FEATURING:

- RANDOMISER
- CREDITS
- COPYRIGHT DATE
- LINKS TO HTML STUFF THAT I MADE
- AND MORE TO COME!


This is mostly just a joke project. I do want to get my own software working on the Wii, and I can't compile C apps for some reason, so this is my best bet.
