        <h2>Interactive Resume</h2>
        <p>Ever thought regular resumes were boring? Well cause they are. It's just<br>
        a bunch of lines of text that we use to prove value in workforce.<br><br>
        Why not instead we do something better? How about a resume that people<br>
        can actually USE and INTERACT with? That helps show value much more.<br><br>
        It's the phrase "A picture can tell a thousand words" all over again, except<br>
        it's now "A HTML site with CSS and JS can tell an entire resume."</p>
