        <h2>Retro Zone</h2>
        <h1 style="color: black;">COMING SOON TO A<br>GFGG-LAND NEAR YOU</h1>
        <p>Retro Zone is a w.i.p part of the site that will showcase old projects of<br>
        mine, along with some nice nostalgic web-design to top it off.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm unsure whether I'll do a basic site with little to no CSS,<br>
        or do a frutiger aero-ish style. Let me know your thoughts!</p>
        <p>Retro Zone has no planned release date, but it will definitely be before<br>
        the end of January. Stay tuned!</p>
